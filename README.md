  ## Description 

  The Employee Management System is a command-line application that allows you to manage your company's employee database. It was built using Node.js and MySQL and provides a user-friendly interface to perform various CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on departments, roles, and employees.

The application uses the inquirer package to prompt the user for input and the console.table package to display data in a formatted table. The MySQL database is used to store and retrieve data, and the mysql2 package is used to connect to and interact with the database.

The Employee Management System offers the following features:

* View all departments, roles, and employees
* Add a new department, role, or employee
* Update an employee's role

  ## Dependencies  

  * npm i inquirer@8.2.4
  * npm i mysql2
  * npm i console.table

  ## Usage 

  To use this application, please install all necessary dependencies and run npm start in the command line. The user will then be prompted to select from the following lists:

  1. View all departments
  2. View all roles
  3. View all employees
  4. Add a department
  5. Add a role
  6. Add an employee
  7. Update an employee role

  The user is able to pick from this list until they select "exit" which will end the prompts and then end the connection with the server.
